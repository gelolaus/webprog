    <p>About Me<br></p>
    <p>
        I am Angelo John Benedict Laus, but you can call me “Gelo”. I am 20 years old and was born on April 23, 2005. I graduated from the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics with a Specialization in Information Technology (STEM-IT) strand at Asia Pacific College, Makati City.<br>
        <br>        
        Currently, I am a Year 2 student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Specialized in Cybersecurity & Forensics (BSCS-SF). I receive a combined 55% scholarship from the APC Loyalty Discount (50%) and the APC Student Ambassador Scholarship (5%). I am a transferee; after graduating Senior High School in August 2023, I initially enrolled in BSCS-SF but transferred to the Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (BSCpE) due to an 80% scholarship opportunity. However, after two terms in BSCpE, I realized that what we were doing was different from what I wanted to pursue. By the third term, I shifted back to BSCS-SF, which was always my first choice, and I am proud to have chosen this degree program.<br>
        <br>
        In terms of IT experience, I would say that I can program but am continuously striving to improve my confidence in my creations. The IT skill I am highly confident with is cybersecurity. Since 2024, my team, Team Akira, has been actively participating in Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions. Notably, we secured Second Runner Up during Hack For Gov NCR 2024 and recently won Champion during Hack For Gov NCR 2025. We are competing at the regional finals on December 9, 2025.<br>
        <br>
        For both my interests and hobbies, I enjoy attending and volunteering at events that I feel connected with. I am an active volunteer for Python Philippines (since PyCon APAC 2025), and we are preparing for PythonAsia 2026. I also love learning about startups, attending the monthly dinners of Sip & Scale, a social event for founders and students. Additionally, I volunteer for other events such as Arduino Day Philippines and Harvard World Model United Nations.
        <br>     
        By taking this Web Programming (WEBPROG) course, I expect to learn the best UI/UX practices when building websites and, most importantly, how to implement DevSecOps to ensure we prioritize secure applications. Relating it to my specialization, I want to learn more about the OWASP Top 10 and gain practical experience in exploiting and fixing web vulnerabilities. It would be cool to try using tools like Burp Suite and experience performing methods like SQL injection and cross-site scripting to further enhance my knowledge in Cybersecurity & Forensics.<br>
        <br>
        For my short-term goals, I want to graduate as a Summa Cum Laude and be able to treat myself to a ticket to ROOTCON. For long-term goals, I want to give back to the community, especially by teaching technology to people who lack knowledge in the field here in the Philippines. I have lots of dreams, but my post-graduation dream is to become a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) for a large company or become part of Google Philippines, then slowly build myself until I reach the Silicon Valley.<br>
        <br>
        Other interesting aspects of my life that I would like to share are as follows: I am a Notion Campus Leader (one out of eight Cohort 4 Campus Leaders in the Philippines), I am the Director of External Relations at JPCS-APC, a role I’ve been doing inside and outside college for different organizations for the past four years, and I have a personal website: https://gelolaus.com, though I promise it’s currently outdated and vibe-coded!
