            <b>About Me</b><br>
            I am Angelo Laus, but you can call me “Gelo”. I graduated from the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics with a Specialization in Information Technology (STEM-IT) strand at Asia Pacific College, Makati City.<br><br>
            I am a Notion Campus Leader (one out of eight Cohort 4 Campus Leaders in the Philippines) and the Director of External Relations at JPCS-APC, a role I’ve been doing inside and outside college for different organizations for the past four years.

            <b>Education / Achievements</b><br>
            I graduated from the STEM-IT strand at Asia Pacific College, Makati City.<br>
            I receive a combined 55% scholarship from the APC Loyalty Discount (50%) and the APC Student Ambassador Scholarship (5%).<br><br>
            My team, Team Akira, secured Second Runner Up during Hack For Gov NCR 2024 and recently won Champion during Hack For Gov NCR 2025. We are competing at the regional finals on December 9, 2025.

            <b>Course</b><br>
            I am a Year 2 student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Specialized in Cybersecurity & Forensics (BSCS-SF). I shifted back to BSCS-SF after two terms in the Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (BSCpE), as BSCS-SF was always my first choice.

            <b>IT Experience</b><br>
            I can program but am continuously striving to improve my confidence in my creations. The IT skill I am highly confident with is cybersecurity. Since 2024, my team, Team Akira, has been actively participating in Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions.<br><br>
            By taking this Web Programming (WEBPROG) course, I expect to learn the best UI/UX practices, how to implement DevSecOps, learn more about the OWASP Top 10, and gain practical experience in exploiting and fixing web vulnerabilities using tools like Burp Suite for methods like SQL injection and cross-site scripting.

            <b>Hobbies & Interests</b><br>
            I enjoy attending and volunteering at events that I feel connected with. I am an active volunteer for Python Philippines (since PyCon APAC 2025), and we are preparing for PythonAsia 2026. I also love learning about startups, attending the monthly dinners of Sip & Scale. Additionally, I volunteer for other events such as Arduino Day Philippines and Harvard World Model United Nations.

            <b>Goals In Life / Dream</b><br>
            For short-term goals, I want to graduate as a Summa Cum Laude and be able to treat myself to a ticket to ROOTCON.<br>
            For long-term goals, I want to give back to the community, especially by teaching technology to people who lack knowledge in the field here in the Philippines.<br><br>
            My post-graduation dream is to become a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) for a large company or become part of Google Philippines, then slowly build myself until I reach the Silicon Valley.
