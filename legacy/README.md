Gelo + OS = GelOS. A fully interactive web-based operating system simulation designed to showcase my skills, certifications, and projects in Computer Science, Cyber Security, and Forensics.

This project runs entirely in the browser using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and Tailwind CSS. No backend required.
